          <p>The territory is bathed in the south by the waters of the Danube River and at the same time is located at the foothills of the Bavarian forest.

          <p>The history of the village would hardly be conceivable without understanding the significant role that Donaustauf castle played in the growth of the region until its destruction in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. The other important point that should be taken into account is the Danube River, which baths Donaustauf. The river, Donau in German, names the town.<!--, which means literally “on the Donau”.--> Geographically, it separates two different regions, the south region, which was inhabited and developed at the time of the conquest of the Bavarians, while the northern area was only made habitable by deforestation. Furthermore, it was the north border of the Roman Empire and it has had important commercial routes since ancient time. An import Roman military camp (<a href"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castra_Regina">Castra Regina</a>) was settled up in Regensburg and the salt trade was an important activity in the area through the centuries.</p>

          <p>Concerning the area of Donaustauf, the oldest findings of a population can be found in Sulzbach, it can be considered as a different area through the history due to its incorporation to Donaustauf administrative center has occurred in recent times. Furthermore, the oldest administrative centre was probably located in Sulzbach.</p>

          <p>Focused on the surrounding area of the current urban center, the earliest findings that denote a permanent population dated from the year 500 before Christ on and they have been located in the hill where the ruins of the castle are still until today. Therefore, it was proved during the excavations performed in 1981/82, when the foundations of a fortress (presumably inhabited by the Celts) were brought to light.</p>

          <p>The construction of the castle took place probably between 914 and 930. This initial castle aimed to protect the nearby town of Regensburg from the Hungarian invasions and was commissioned by Bishop Tuto. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishops_of_Regensburg">Tuto</a> was the ninth bishop of Regensburg as well as head of St. Emmeram's Abbey. The territory of Donaustauf was given as a donation of the King Conrad I to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Emmeram%27s_Abbey">St. Emmeram Abbey </a>. After the separation of the Abbey and the bishopric, the territory went in 1031 to the diocese.</p>

          <p>Until the 13<sup>th</sup> century Donaustauf could be kept in the possession of the Regensburger bishops, although straggles between diocese, King and Dukes were frequents. The first known rule about Donaustauf is dated in 1285. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_I_of_Germany">Rudolf von Habsburg </a> confirmed county rights for Donaustauf. In the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> century the change of owner's continued, Emperor Charles IV, Deke Otto V and Duke Stephen were some of the owner's among others. In 1486, Donaustauf and together with Regensburg, went into the hands of the Duke of Bavaria, Albrecht IV. The market rights were bestowed to Donautauf ten years later. In 1592 a lightning struck in the castle tower and the entire system has been greatly affected.</p>

          <p>The Swedish invasion is one of the phases of the "30 Years' War". This phase ravaged central-Europe from 1630 to 1635. Swedish-protestant army invaded Bavaria, crushed Bavarian troops and occupied the region forcing to pay taxes. In opposition, different revolts erupted in opposition to the taxation. In 1633, the Swedish troops invaded Regensburg. In this context, the Bavarian troops stationed in the castle intercepted a convoy of 60 truckloads salt supplies for the occupied area. In retaliation, Swedish troops led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_of_Saxe-Weimar">Bernard of Saxe-Weimar</a>, captured the castle and destroyed it mostly. Although the plant of the castle was poorly repaired, the castle has been in ruins since then. </p>

          <p>In 1710 Donaustauf returned to the Bishopric of Regensburg. In 1803 was incorporated into the new created Archbishopric of Regensburg, also known such as Principality of Regensburg. In 1810 came to Bavaria, according to the Treaty of Paris. The complete Donaustauf is acquired by the Princes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurn_und_Taxis">Thurn and Taxis</a> in 1812, who owns the title of Duke of Wörth an der Donau since 1899th. An important palace was built for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurn_und_Taxis">Thurn and Taxis</a> family in 1843, but it fell in 1880 to a huge fire together with the 60% of the buildings in the village. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_I_of_Bavaria">Louis I of Bavaria </a>(Ludwig I) who was an admirer of ancient Greece, patronized arts and different neoclassical building.

        <p>The St Michael parish church is located on the southern slope of the castle hill, specifically in Albertus-Magnus-Weg 5, and as all the town its history is linked to the history of the castle. Since 1245 Donaustauf was an independent parish. Therefore a medieval parish church was located in the space where the actual St Michael church is today. In the 14<sup>th</sup> century Donaustauf was chosen as one of the four deanships and thus one of the most important parishes of the bishopric. The initial construction was destroyed after the sieges of the castle in 1388 and rebuilt again 1397.</p>



</div>

<div class="col-sm-7">

<p>The records of the 16<sup>th</sup> century brought to light clearer recordings of the parish and even to the political history of Donaustauf. One important figure in the deanships was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishops_of_Regensburg">Otto Heinrich Bachmair</a>, who was additionally auxiliary bishop of Regensburg from 1622 to 1634.</p>

<p>Together with the castle, the church was ravaged by war and disaster and the rectory burned down. During the Thirty Years War the parish was burned. According to the different recordings, the church had different predecessors. Before the current building, the church was dedicated to St. Florian and it was ruined by a fire in 1724.</p>

<p>Commissioned by the Pastor Georg Friedrich Weinzierl, the current late baroque complex was built up. It was consecrated in 1703 to the patron St. Michael. The octagonal tower visible today corresponds in his foundation of an older arrangement. The cemetery walls located next to the current structure are probably from the 18<sup>th</sup> century. In 1860 the church had already five altars and four bells. A pulpit and three new altars were commissioned by Pastor Wallner (1913-1931).

The pilgrimage is based in a robbery took place in 1388 during one of the sieges of the Donaustauf castle. Three soldiers robbed the communion of the church of Sulzbach and they hide them in the forest.

<p>The church suffered (as in the rest of the region) ravage during the Thirty Years War. In 1633 the church minister reported that the church was broken open repeatedly by the Swedish troops. In 1635 reparations were made in windows and doors. The damages caused by the Swedish troops were also reported in 1642 when they stole 253 florins from it. Nevertheless, the pilgrimage didn´t stop as it is expressed in the different contributions made to other churches. From the 17<sup>th</sup> century is the statue of Saint Salvator, which after the last renovation, stands in the middle of the church, just in the place where the communion wafers were hidden. The bells of Saint Salvator also come from this time. They were poured 1643 in Straubing and they are still today hand operated.</p> 

<p>Structural changes were experienced by the building in the 18<sup>th</sup> century in order to be adapted to the baroque style. At that time 13 ceiling paintings were created by <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Gebhard">Otto Gebhard</a> (pupil of the brothers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asam_brothers">Asam</a>) following the theme of the Eucharist.

The rococo organ as well as the pulpit dated also from the first part of the 18<sup>th</sup> century. </p>

<p>The flow of pilgrims was decreased. At the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> century the Walhalla was built. Under the idea of a harmonious view in the Danube formed by the Donaustauf castle the St. Salvator church and the Walhalla, the exterior appearance was strongly transformed. The goal was to lead back the church to its original Bizantine aspect by removing the different baroque elements. Tower, roof and windows were transformed to accomplish this goal. The restoration was according the new neo-Romanesque style, common in Germany in the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> century which was inspired in the 11th-12th Romanesque architecture. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_von_Klenze">Leo von Klenze</a>, same architect than in the Walhalla, was the responsible of the renovation.<a name="Walhalla"></a></p>

<p>In the restoration done in 1970-1980, original paintings were discovered under a 5 cm thick cleaning layer which could be got in bigger range in the west part of the church. These are outstanding works of an Italian artist, painted in 1400, a rare example of its kind of art in Bavaria. The paintings show scenes from the New Testament. The well-preserved fresco right of the main entrance of the church shows the flagellation of Christ.</p>

During this time, Bavaria behaved as a satellite state of Napoleon and in gratefulness he elevated from Electorate to Kingdom and consequently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_I_Joseph_of_Bavaria">Maximilian</a> I was crowned as the first Bavarian king.

<p>In 1807, Prince Ludwig started with the idea of bringing together the common German heritage and history.

<p>The first stone of the monument was placed in 1830 in a position high above the Danube in the east of Donaustauf and 10 km away of the city of Regensburg. The monument was finished in 1842 and named as Walhalla that means paradise in Norse mythology. Inspired by the Parthenon, Leo von Klenze designed a building in the form of a temple surrounded by a portico. The combination of the colonnaded temple, the massive substructure required to support the complex and an original interior preserves the monument to be a copy of the Greek monument. Both pediment friezes show relevant events in German history, while the southern features the creation of the German Confederation in 1815, the northern is ornamented with scenes from the Battle of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Scholl">Teutoburg Forest</a>in 9 after ChristD.</p>

<p>At the inauguration of the monument, 96 busts and 64 plaques for those which a portrait was not available. The German Tongue was the selection criterion for the chosen of the bust, however a wider range is included. That’s why before 1871, with the formation of a German state, German refers to Germanic, including Gothic, Langobardic, Anglo-Saxon, Austrian, Dutch and Swiss. Therefore personalities from countries far away from the current Germany has a bust there. Whereas the Valhalla of Norse mythology served as home to those gloriously slain in battle, Ludwig intended his Walhalla not only for warriors, but also for scientists, writers, and clerics, and specifically included both men and women. National Socialist organizations, such as “Kraft durch Freude” promotes Walhalla as a cultural visit. In 1937, Hitler unveiled a bust of the Austrian compositor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Bruckner">Bruckner</a> and the number of visitors went to 131 520. Walhalla was also an important point in the Second World War, when the allies forces.

Only 31 busts have been added since its opening. Since 1962 new busts have been added to the original 96 at intervals of five to seven years. The selection is made by the Bavarian Council of Ministers, advised by the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. The last busts have been dedicated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Scholl">Sophie Scholl</a> (2003), a Munich student who was executed in 1943 for her non-violent resistance to the system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Stein">Edith Stein</a> (2009), nun and philosophe died in a concentration camp, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Heine">Heinrich Heine</a> who was a German romantic poet whose works were set to music by Strauss, Wagner and Brahms.</p>

<p>The Princely house of Thurn and Taxis is a German noble family who managed the main role in the postal services during the 16th century. There are also known because of their possessions, especially breweries, castles and palaces.</p>

<p>The aristocratic family is originally from Bergamo, Italy, under the name of Tasso. They moved to Germany and they were designed as Count (Grafen in German) in 1624. In 1650 they changed their name to “Della Torre e Tasso” which “Thurn und Taxis” is the German translation, used since now to name the family. The Holy Roman emperor Leopold I, gave them the title of Princes.</p>

<p>Ruggiano de Tasses founded a postal service in Italy in the last of the 15th century and in 1489 the monopoly of this service was awarded for the complete Holy Roman Empire. Despite the numerous conflicts and wars in central Europa the postal service was extended to new routes in Brussels, France, Spain or Rome by using a huge network of messengers and post-office around Europe. </p>

Despite that they have preserved a large net of possessions in different countries, especially castles and palaces.</p>

<p>In 1810, the territory of Donaustauf, with the restriction of the sovereignty, was given to the Princes of Thurn and Taxis as an indemnity for the imperial posts, which had been retired by the Kingdom of Bavaria.. In 1815, the family received as well the imperial Abbey of St. Emmeram, since then their official residence. In 1899 are titled as Duke to Wörth an der Donau and Donaustauf.

<p>Close to the palace was located the hunting forest attached to the family. The similar to park and landscape with forester`s houses and hunting lodges encloses an area of 2.800 hectares in which, among other things lynxes, wild boars, red deer, beaver, otter, black storks, scrapper-cleanings, yellow belly toads and toads live. A golf club is nowadays located in the area. </p><br></br>

              <p>The purpose of a 3D laser scanner is to create a point cloud of the surface of a objetc. Nowadays there a wide amount of scanners in the market and they can acquire information in small and large scenes. The three principles of laser scanners include Time of flight (TOF), Phase Shift and Triangulation-based systems.</p>

              A structured light scanner is a 3D intruments to achieve the 3D shape of a object. It uses projection light patterns and a camera system (usually two cameras). Projection band of lights onto an object, produces line distorted from the different perspectives, and it is used to extract the 3D information about the object.
