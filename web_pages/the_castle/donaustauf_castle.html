            <p>Donaustauf is located 10 km East of Regensburg, city which continues the legacy of Radasbona Celtic settlement and the Roman camp of Castra Regina. There, in the location where the Bavarian forest starts, a hill is raised about 100 m above the Danube. A 230 m * 150 m plateau stands at the top of the hill and is protected with drastic height differences. Due to such topographic conditions as well as their privilege position for the Danube waterway domination, the hill has been predestined for a grand Settlement since ancient times. <br></br></p>

<p>Archaeology excavations performed since 1960 in the area near the cemetery have brought to light evidences that confirm the use of the hill as a Mountain Manor and evidences of activity in the Late Hallstatt and Early La Téne periods. New excavations in 1981-1982 discovered new evidences such as a huge wall more than 6 meters wide. The wall was built with large stone blocks in the exterior part while the interior was formed by loosely stones. Furthermore, in front of this construction, massive earth movements in the North Slope of the castle were performed. Therefore, this a possible indicator for the presence of a well-organized community. Additionally, these presupposes are supplemented by extensive archaeological material, including high quality ceramics, or an iron fibula with enamel and coral deposits. These findings have been dated around 500 before Christ.</div>

Other findings from the Iron Age are preserved in the valley surrounding the castle. Its support the idea than the today preserved east and south walls sit on the prehistoric structures. The terrace structure of the castle suggests to researchers the idea that the southern tip of the mountain in Celtic times, although no complete evidences are founded. The size of the plant, and the topographically prominent position in visual contact with the Danube are the evidences used by the experts to ensure the idea of the Celtic structure. Other fortifications in the area support this idea, such as the castle hill in <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgruine_Kallm%C3%BCnz"> Kallmünz</a>. As elsewhere in the Celtic excavations of the area, the hillfort of Donaustauf was abandoned in 350 before Christ.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages the Donaustauf Castle became the scene of numerous battles and conflicts. A route through the history of the castle allows to understand the turbulent history of the area in this period as well as to comprise the importance of the castle where just ruins are visible today.</p>

<p>During the Carolingian period, the castle hill was a part of the vast royal Forest of Sulzbach. In 911, Conrad I was elected king of the East Francia by the rulers of Saxonia, Swabia and Bavaria. Conrad I, who was already duke of Franconia and the son of the Duke of Thuringia, found very difficult to establish his authority over the growing power of the dukes. Indeed, Conrad I died due to the injuries caused by one of the battles with Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria. Within this background of continuous clashes between the Bavarian duke and the King, Conrad I gave in 914 the Imperial forest to the monastery of St. Emmeram, whose abbot also exercised the episcopate at this time. Under this donation, the King aimed to reinforce the Regensburg as an institution in his favour. </p>

<p>Being Tuto bishop of Regensburg (<i>abbot ex oficio</i>), the first reference of the castle is found. This document dated between 914 and 930, mentions arrangements in the castle area, <i>Castellum quod dicitur Stufo</i>. This first structure was mounted over the remains of the Celtic structures and in the same dimensions. The excavations in 1982 proved that wood and earth walls were erected over the celtic structures. Probably, this first castle was used as refuge at that time. After that the castle was seriously improved, presumably in order to be protected against the Hungarian raids, which during the first half of the 10<sup>th</sup> century affected the Upper Palatinate. This first period of invasions was finished in 1955 when some military leaders are hanged in Regensburg, after the victory of Otto I the Great in the battle of Lechfeld.</p>

</div>

<div class="col-sm-7">

<p>In 975, Saint Wolfgang of Regensburg (bishop of Regensburg at that time), gave up voluntarily the position of abbot, making the abbot of St. Emmeram's independant of the bishopric. He was one of the first German bishops to do this, and his example in this was much copied across Germany in the years following. Bus this decision, the castle and the forest of Sulzbach came Episcopal possesion. In order to protect the bishops of Regensburg the castle is important fortified as stronghold being used as a refugee. In the second half of the 11<sup>th</sup>, it became into the seconday episcopal residence and it was generously expanded.</p>

  <p>

In 12<sup>th</sup>, Donaustauf castle was one of the scenarios where the heavy clashes among the Duke of Bavaria and the Bishop authority of Regensburg took place. Within the confilct, the monument suffered diverses attacks and lootings. The main cause of the conflict was the domination and rights about Regensburg, which was at that time a thriving commercial city. In 1132, Count Frederick of Bogen and the Duke Heinrich the Proud sought to stablish their own candidates as Bishops. The Choice of Heinrich of Wolfratshausen in 1132 opened the conflict, due to the Duke didn't recognize the new bishop sustaining that the election had been partly against the rules. The conflict was partially ended with the submission of the Count in 1933. However the castle was twice occupied and burned.</p>
<p>The next feud ignited between same Bishop Heinrich and duke Henry Jasomirgott in 1143. The Duke endeavored in vain to win Regensburg, however during the movement the ducal troops occupied and ravaged the castle. The Succesors of both, Duke Henry the Lion and Bishop Hartwig II of Ortenburg, continued the struggles for the control of the city around 1161. Due to the conitnuos conflicts, the castle was eextensively strengthened from up to bottom until it appeared impregnable. In fact, despite the conflicts continued but the castle was not conquered even when in 1196 the Duke troops devastated completely the episcopal possessions. Therefore, Donaustauf castle became again in a safe refugy for the bishop.</p>

  <p>In spite of these continuous struggles, Regensburg exprienced a economic period of bloom. The far trade to Paris, Venice and Kiev became it in one of the most powerful cities of the empire. Still today the Romanesque and Gothic architecture of this ages determines the face of the city center, with monuments such as the stone bridge built up from 1135 to 1146. Furthermore, the bridge was an important place for the Danub crossing of the crusade armies. In all this activities Donaustauf castle had an important rule due to its control advantages over the Danub.</p>

<p>The balance among the bishop and the Duke was foun at the beginning of the 13<sup>th</sup> century. From 1232, Bishop Siegfried enforced a sole dominion over the city, which was hardly accepted by the citizens. In 1245, the emperor felt betrayed by the Bishop in front of the Pope. As a result, the Kaiser Frederick II converted Regensburg in a free Imperial city and gave the Citizens the right of self-government. </p>

<p>Once again, the succesors continued hostilities. Albert I, the new elected bishop, relatiated agians the free citizens and in 1250, 45 citizens were arrested. In response, King conrad IV (Frederick II succesor) devastated the complete episcopal possesions. The bishop, who has been refuged in the castle had to escape from the city. Under a royal Guarantee he got again into the town, but after he was involved of an failed assassination plot against the king he scaped again. Finally the peace came in 1253, which was consolidated with the new bishop, Saint Albert II (Albertus Magnus). He was well-kown scholar and one of the gratest German philosopher and theologian of the Middle Ages. He is distingished as one of the 36 Doctors of the Chatolic Church. During his bishoship in Regensburg (1260-1262) he gained an enhances reputation for humility by refusing to ride a horse, according the rules of his order, and travelled his huge diocese on foot. From Donaustauf castle he wrote his withdraw. </p>

<div class="col-sm-12">

<p>A fire in the cathedral in 1273, raised up the idea of the construction of a great cathedral for Regensburg. Under the mandate of Leo the Thundorfer, the constuction of the current cathedral began. Under his bishoship, the abbot and two monks were imprisioned in the castle after a conflict between the dioceses and St. Emmeram abbey. The construction of the new cathedral involved hardly Donaustuaf. After was being used by the bishop as refugee or second residence, the debts related to the gothic cathedral converted the castle in a mortgage object. Therefore, it started to go from hand to hand, starting in 1301 when it was pledged for the hirst time. During this period (1285) county rights were confirmed to Donaustauf. In 1353 the pledge went to the king of Bohemia and 1373 it changed hands again and it was passed to the Wttelsbach house. After the beginning of a new conflict, this time among the Duke and the city, the bishoship decided to buy he castle again and it was lent to the city. The castle was then enforced for be able to resist the thread of the Duke. In 1388, the castle held the Siege during the city war. Finally, due to financial bankrupt of Regensburg, the castle was sold to the Duke of Bavaria, Albrecht IV in 1486.</p>


<p>In 1592 a lightning struck in the castle tower and the entire system has been greatly affected. The Swedish invasion, which is one of the phases of the "30 Years' War", ravaged central-Europe from 1630 to 1635. The castle was enforced, expanded and modificated in order to hosted cannon bastions. During this time, Swedish-protestant army invaded Bavaria, crushed Bavarian troops and occupied the region forcing to pay taxes. In opposition, different revolts erupted in opposition to the taxation. In 1633, the Swedish troops invaded Regensburg. In this context, the Bavarian troops stationed in the castle intercepted a convoy of 60 truckloads salt supplies for the occupied area. In retaliation, Swedish troops led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_of_Saxe-Weimar">Bernard of Saxe-Weimar</a>, captured the castle and destroyed it mostly. Under the idea of rebuilt the castle, new accomodations for the soldiers were executed in the castle, but the idea was abandoned because of the fortification value was in questions, due to the easy development of firest in the surrounding of it. Although the plant of the castle was poorly repaired, the castle has been in ruins since then. </p>

  <p>In 1710 Donaustauf returned to the Bishopric of Regensburg. In 1803 was incorporated into the new created Archbishopric of Regensburg, also known such as Principality of Regensburg. In 1810 came to Bavaria, according to the Treaty of Paris. The complete Donaustauf is acquired by the Princes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurn_und_Taxis">Thurn and Taxis</a> in 1812, who owns the title of Duke of Wörth an der Donau since 1899th. An important palace was built for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurn_und_Taxis">Thurn and Taxis</a> family in 1843, but it fell in 1880 to a huge fire together with the 60% of the buildings in the village. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_I_of_Bavaria">Louis I of Bavaria </a>(Ludwig I) who was an admirer of ancient Greece, patronized arts and different neoclassical building. Among them, the <a href="#Walhalla">Walhalla</a> was built up in 1842 is still today an important tourist attraction.</p>

<p>Thurn and Taxis family used the for administration building of Donaustuaf as the first face of their summer palace. By transforming the building in different stages as well as adding a park and a ridding space. Under the era of romanticism, they took the castle ruins under their idea, found particularly interesting the combination among ruins, nature and sights to the Danub. Following this principle they did several actuations in the castle. The horicultural shape of the castle was redesign and avenue of lime trees along the eintrance are still visibles. At the same time they aimed to preserve the ruin characteristics o the castle, therefore diverses reparation works were performed in the remained structures but always under the idea of retaining the ruin characteristics.</p>

<p>When the Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria planned the contruction of monument to pay tribute to the glorious excellent german, under idea of propagation the german union. For that purpose the landscape to locate the monument should be selected with great care. East of Donaustauf accomplished different criterions to create a misthic and amazing environment. In first place, the position close to Donaustauf would provide it electricity. Additionally, the lanscape offers different important views; the first, the historic city of Regensburg first sit for Bayern dukes, and center for emperors of the Holy Roman German Empire. Secondly the combination of the leafy forest where the Walhalla is placed and the view of the vast fertile plains south of the Danube occupied by anci

              <p>The purpose of a 3D laser scanner is to create a point cloud of the surface of a objetc. Nowadays there a wide amount of scanners in the market and they can acquire information in small and large scenes. The three principles of laser scanners include Time of flight (TOF), Phase Shift and Triangulation-based systems.</p>

              A structured light scanner is a 3D intruments to achieve the 3D shape of a object. It uses projection light patterns and a camera system (usually two cameras). Projection band of lights onto an object, produces line distorted from the different perspectives, and it is used to extract the 3D information about the object.
