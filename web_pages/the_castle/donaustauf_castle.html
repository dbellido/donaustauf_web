The history of both locations are closely linked, and significant historical events have succeeded through time, since the legacy of Radasbona Celtic settlement and the Roman camp of <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castra_Regina">Castra Regina</a> to the important role of Regensburg in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> or the <a href="">Thirty Year's War</a>. Still today, relevant monuments from different periods allow the visitors to understand the historic importance of the area. Furthermore the medieval Regensburg, declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, or the <a href="donaustauf_village.html#Walhalla">Walhalla</a> monument in Donaustauf draw thousands of tourists’ attention each year. </p>

            <p>In this environment, the ruins of a castle are located on the top of a 100m height hill,  of the current town of Donaustauf. From the top, the visitor can easily understand the strategic situation of the fortification, with the domination of the Danube and its fertile plains in the south and the commencement of the <a href="https://www.bayerischer-wald.de/">Bavarian forest</a> at the northeast. The castle stands on a 230 m &times; 150 m plateau and is protected with drastic height differences. Due to such topographic conditions as well as their privilege position for the Danube waterway domination, the hill has been predestined for a grand settlement since ancient times.<br></br></p>

<p>Archaeology excavations have been performed since 1960, when in the area near the cemetery have brought to light evidences that confirm the use of the hill as a Mountain Manor and evidences of activity in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallstatt_culture">Late Hallstatt</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_T%C3%A8ne_culture">Early La Téne</a> periods. New excavations in 1981-1982 discovered new evidences such as a huge wall more than 6 meters wide. The wall was built with large stone blocks in the exterior part while the interior was formed by loosely stones. Furthermore, in front of this construction, evidences of massive earth movements in the North Slope of the castle were shown. Therefore, this a possible indicator for the presence of a well-organized community. Additionally, these presupposes are supplemented by extensive archaeological material, including high quality ceramics, or <a href="#fibula" title="figure b2">an iron fibula with enamel and coral deposits</a>. These findings have been dated around 500 before Christ.</div>

Other findings from the Iron Age were discovered in the valley surrounding the castle. It supports to the idea than the today preserved east and south walls sit on prehistoric structures. The terrace structure of the castle suggests to the researchers the idea that fortification fits with the southern tip of the inhabited mountain in Celtic times, although no complete evidences are founded. The size of the plant, and the topographically prominent position in visual contact with the Danube are the evidences used by the experts to ensure the idea of the Celtic structure. Other fortifications in the area support this, such as the castle hill in <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgruine_Kallm%C3%BCnz"> Kallmünz</a>. As elsewhere in the Celtic excavations of the area, the hillfort of Donaustauf was abandoned in 350 before Christ.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages the Donaustauf Castle became the scene of numerous battles and conflicts. A route through the history of the castle allows to understand the turbulent history of the area in this period as well as to comprise the importance the castle had in the place where just ruins are visible today.</p>

<p>During the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Loves_Monuments_2016/Deutschland/Preise">Carolingian period</a>, the castle hill was a part of the vast royal Forest of <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulzbach_an_der_Donau">Sulzbach</a>. In 911, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_I_of_Germany">Conrad I</a> was elected king of the East France by the rulers of Saxonia, Swabia and Bavaria. Conrad I, who was already duke of Franconia and the son of the Duke of Thuringia, found very difficult to establish his authority over the growing power of the dukes. Indeed, Conrad I died due to the injuries caused by one of the battles with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnulf,_Duke_of_Bavaria">Arnulf</a>, Duke of Bavaria. Within this background of continuous clashes between the Bavarian duke and the King, Conrad I gave in 914 the Imperial forest to the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kloster_Sankt_Emmeram">monastery of St. Emmeram</a>, whose abbot also exercised the episcopate at this time. Under this donation, the King aimed to reinforce the Regensburg clergy as an institution in his favour. </p>

<p>Being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishops_of_Regensburg">Tuto</a> bishop of Regensburg (<i>abbot ex oficio</i>), the first reference of the castle is found. This document, dated between 914 and 930, mentions arrangements in the castle area, <i>Castellum quod dicitur Stufo</i>. The name Stufo is the Old High German name for a conical rock or mountaintop. Probably this first fortification was mounted over the remains of the Celtic structures and in the same dimensions. The excavations in 1982 proved that wood and earth walls were erected over the celtic structures. The initial phase of the castle was used as refuge. After that the castle was seriously improved, presumably in order to be protected against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_invasions_of_Europe">Hungarian raids</a>, which during the first half of the 10<sup>th</sup> century affected the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Palatinate">Upper Palatinate</a>. This first period of invasions was finished in 955 when important Hungarian military leaders are hanged in Regensburg, after the victory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Otto I the Great</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lechfeld_(955)">the battle of Lechfeld</a>.</p>

</div>

<div class="col-sm-7">

<p>In 975, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_of_Regensburg">Saint Wolfgang of Regensburg</a> (bishop of Regensburg at that time), gave up voluntarily the position of abbot, making the abbey of St. Emmeram's independent of the bishopric. He was one of the first German bishops to do this, and it was copied repeatedly across Germany in the subsequent years. After this decision, the castle and the forest of Sulzbach became Episcopal possesions. In order to protect the bishops of Regensburg the castle is fortified as stronghold. In the second half of the 11<sup>th</sup>, it became into the secondary episcopal residence and it was generously expanded.</p>

  <p>

In 12<sup>th</sup> century, Donaustauf castle was one of the scenarios where heavy clashes among the Duke of Bavaria and the Bishop authority of Regensburg took place. Within the conflict, the monument suffered diverse attacks and lootings. The main cause of the conflict was the domination and rights about Regensburg, which was at that time a thriving commercial city. In 1132, Count Frederick of Bogen and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_X,_Duke_of_Bavaria">Duke Heinrich the Proud</a> sought to stablish their own candidates as Bishops. The Choice of <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_I._von_Wolfratshausen">Heinrich of Wolfratshausen</a> in 1132 opened the conflict, due to the Duke didn't recognize the new bishop sustaining that the election had been partly against the rules. The conflict was partially ended with the submission of the Count in 1133. However the castle was twice occupied and burned.</p>

<p>The next feud was ignited between same Bishop Heinrich and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II,_Duke_of_Austria">Duke Henry Jasomirgott</a> in 1143. The Duke endeavoured in vain to win Regensburg, however during the movement the ducal troops occupied and ravaged the castle. The Successors of both, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_the_Lion">Duke Henry the Lion</a> and Bishop Hartwig II of Ortenburg, continued the struggles for the control of the city around 1161. Due to the continuous conflicts, the castle was extensively strengthened from up to bottom until it appeared impregnable. In fact, despite the conflicts continued but the castle was not conquered even when in 1196 the Duke troops devastated completely the episcopal possessions. Therefore, Donaustauf castle became again in a safe refuge for the bishop.</p>

          <p>The Hungarian invasions of Europe took place in the 9th and 10th centuries, the period of transition in the history of Europe between the early and high medieval period, when the territory of the former Carolingian Empire was threatened by invasion from multiple hostile forces, the Magyars (Hungarians) from the east, the Norsemen from the north and the Arabs from the south (wiki).</p>
          <p>Donaustauf castle was strengthened in order to be defended against the invasions. This first period of invasions was finished in 955 when important Hungarian military leaders are hanged in Regensburg, after the victory of Otto I the Great in the battle of Lechfeld. The battle has been viewed as a symbolic victory who would define European warfare in the High Middle Ages.</p><br></br>

          <p>Saint Wolfgang of Regensburg (934-994) was bishop of Regensburg from Christmas 972 until his death. He is a saint of the Roman Catholic and one of the three great German saints of the 10th century. 
        He was descended from a noble family and he received a notable education. Wolfgang joined the Benedictine orfer in 964, was ordained priest in 968 and was moved to Hungary after the battle of Lechfeld in order to evanglize the area.</p>
        <p>As bishop of Regensburg he took relevant missions, such as be the tutor of the future Emperor Saint Henry II. Under his authority St. Emmeram's Abbey was deeply reformed and it was finally separated from the Bishopric of Regensburg. This event is especially important for Donaustauf caslte, who changes its owner. Since this moment the Bishopric will use it as second residence or as a deffensive structure.</p> 
        <p>Saint Wolfgang was retired at the end of his days as a hermit in a solitary spot close to a lake todays knwon as Wolfgang's Lake (Wolfgangsee) in Upper Austria. There he fell ill and finally was buried in St. Emmeram's Abbey. After that he has been honoured and several towns are named after him, including the market town of St. Wolfgang where the legend says that the saint forced the devile to help him to build a church in the spot indicated by god. The chapel is still preserved in the village inside the main church next to the lake.  </p>

        <div class="modal-body">
          <p>The Stone Bridge (Steinerne Brücke) is a 12th-century bridge across the Danube linking the Old Town of Regensburg with the neighbourhood of Stadtamhof. It is a masterwork of medieval construction and theemblem of the city together with the ghotic St. Peters' cathedral.
            </p>

<p>The bridge was probably built between 1135 and 1146 and it replaced an older wooden bridge 100 m east. The new bridge was originally 336 meters long and had 16 archs. Three towers were incorporated in the north, south borders and in the middel of the bridge. Additionally numerous sculptures adorned it and a salt store was built in the south extreme. The construction of the bridge converted Regensburg and the surrounding area in a important trade location. The bridge was during centuries the only bridge available between Ulm and Vienna during centuries. It was not only used for commercial purposes, but crusade armies used it to cross the Danube.</p>

<p>Its construction implied a revolution and different fortifications guaranted the control of the commercial trade. Due to that, the Donaustauf castle located 10km East played an important role, but also its entailed its destruction when a salt caravanne from Regensurg was intercepted. </p>

  <p>In spite of these continuous struggles, Regensburg experienced an economic period of bloom. The trade routes to Paris, Venice and Kiev became it in one of the most powerful cities of the empire. Still today the Romanesque and Gothic architecture of these ages determines the face of the city centre, with monuments such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Bridge_(Regensburg)">Steinerne Brucke (Stone Bridge)</a> built up from 1135 to 1146. Furthermore, the bridge was an important place used by the crusade armies to save the mighty Danube River. In all this activities Donaustauf castle had a major rule due to its favourable location for controlling the main routes next to the river.</p>

<p>The balance among the bishop and the Duke was found at the beginning of the 13<sup>th</sup> century. From 1232, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegfried_(Regensburg)">Bishop Siegfried</a> enforced a sole dominion over the city, which was hardly accepted by the citizens. In 1245, the emperor felt betrayed by the Bishop in front of the Pope. As a result, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Kaiser Frederick II</a> converted Regensburg in a free Imperial city and gave the Citizens the right of self-government. </p>

<p>Once again, the successors continued hostilities. <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_I._von_Pietengau">Albert I</a>, the new elected bishop, retaliated against the free citizens and in 1250, 45 citizens were arrested. In response, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_IV_of_Germany">Emperor Conrad IV</a> (Frederick II successor) devastated the complete episcopal possessions. The bishop, who had being taking refuge in the castle had to escape from the city. Under a royal Guarantee he got again into the city, but after he was involved of a failed assassination plot he had to leave again. Finally the peace came in 1253, which was consolidated with the new bishop, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertus_Magnus">Saint Albert the Great (Albertus Magnus)</a>. He was a well-known scholar and one of the most important German philosopher and theologian of the Middle Ages. He is distingished as one of the 36 Doctors of the Chatolic Church. During his bishopric in Regensburg (1260-1262) he gained a reputation for humility by refusing to ride a horse, according the rules of his order, and travelled his huge diocese on foot. From Donaustauf castle he wrote his withdraw. </p>

<p>A fire in the cathedral in 1273, raised up the idea of the construction of a great cathedral for Regensburg. Under the mandate of <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Thundorfer">Leo the Thundorfer</a>, the construction of the current cathedral began. The construction of the new cathedral involved hardly Donaustuaf. After it was being used by the bishop as refuge or second residence, the debts related to the gothic cathedral converted the castle in a mortgage object. Therefore, it started to go from hand to hand, starting in 1301 when it was pledged for first time. During this period (1285) county rights were confirmed to the Donaustauf village which had grown around the castle. In 1353 the pledge went to the King of Bohemia and 1373 it changed hands again and it was passed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wittelsbach">Wittelsbach house</a>. After the beginning of a new conflict, this time among the Duke and the city, the bishopric decided to buy the castle again and lent it to the city. The castle was then enforced in order to be able to resist the thread of the Duke. In 1388, the castle held the Siege during the city war. Finally, due to financial bankrupt of Regensburg, the castle was sold to the Duke of Bavaria, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_IV,_Duke_of_Bavaria">Albrecht IV in 1486</a>.</p>


<p>In 1592 a lightning struck in the castle tower and the entire system has been greatly affected. The Swedish invasion, which is one of the phases of the "30 Years' War", ravaged central-Europe from 1630 to 1635. The castle was enforced, expanded and modified in order to hosted cannon bastions. During this time, Swedish-protestant army invaded Bavaria, crushed Bavarian troops and occupied the region forcing to pay taxes. In opposition, different revolts erupted in opposition to the taxation. In 1633, the Swedish troops invaded Regensburg. In this context, the Bavarian troops stationed in the castle intercepted a convoy of 60 truckloads salt supplies for the occupied area. In retaliation, Swedish troops led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_of_Saxe-Weimar">Bernard of Saxe-Weimar</a>, captured the castle and destroyed it mostly. Under the idea of rebuilt the castle, new accommodations for the soldiers were executed in the castle, but the idea was abandoned because of the fortification value was in questions, due to the easy development of fires in the surrounding hill. Although the plant of the castle was poorly repaired, the castle has been in ruins since then. </p>

  <p>In 1710 Donaustauf returned to the Bishopric of Regensburg. In 1803 was incorporated into the new created Archbishopric of Regensburg, also known such as Principality of Regensburg. In 1810 came to Bavaria, according to the Treaty of Paris. The complete Donaustauf is acquired by the Princes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurn_und_Taxis">Thurn and Taxis</a> in 1812, who owns the title of Duke of Wörth an der Donau since 1899th. An important palace was built for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurn_und_Taxis">Thurn and Taxis</a> family in 1843, but it fell in 1880 to a huge fire together with the 60% of the buildings in the village. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_I_of_Bavaria">Louis I of Bavaria </a>(Ludwig I) who was an admirer of ancient Greece, patronized arts and different neoclassical building. Among them, the <a href="#Walhalla">Walhalla</a> was built up in 1842 is still today an important tourist attraction.</p>

<p>Thurn and Taxis family used the for administration building of Donaustuaf as the first face of their summer palace. By transforming the building in different stages as well as adding a park and a ridding space. Under the era of romanticism, they took the castle ruins under their idea, found particularly interesting the combination among ruins, nature and sights to the Danub. Following this principle they did several actuations in the castle. The horicultural shape of the castle was redesign and avenue of lime trees along the eintrance are still visibles. At the same time they aimed to preserve the ruin characteristics o the castle, therefore diverses reparation works were performed in the remained structures but always under the idea of retaining the ruin characteristics.</p>

<p>When the Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria planned the contruction of monument to pay tribute to the glorious excellent german, under idea of propagation the german union. For that purpose the landscape to locate the monument should be selected with great care. East of Donaustauf accomplished different criterions to create a misthic and amazing environment. In first place, the position close to Donaustauf would provide it electricity. Additionally, the lanscape offers different important views; the first, the historic city of Regensburg first sit for Bayern dukes, and center for emperors of the Holy Roman German Empire. Secondly the combination of the leafy forest where the Walhalla is placed and the view of the vast fertile plains south of the Danube occupied by anci

      <p>The castle was built up in difference phases and it was strengthened from top to bottom. Furthermore, the castle was modfied trouhg time according its different uses, the architecture or the deffensive requirements. Due to these actions the castle resulted an extensive complex with different section divided by six consecutives gates. Of the original six gates four are still visible nowadays. In addition, the inner bailey was separated from the second gate by a trench.</p>

      <p>The oldest parts of the castle which original layout is still preserved are dated around 1060/1070. The four gates are included as well as the round-tower, the southern wall and the chapel.</p>

      <p>The stump of the eastern round tower of humpbacks below the palace has a diameter of 15 m and a wall thickness of 5 m, and only came later to secure the unprotected side to the plateau of the foreshore. As a gun position, he was probably only used later.

The early Romanesque square chapel on the upper floor of the inner gate tower had a three-aisled hall with three yokes, of which the north and west walls are preserved with half-round wall niches and side columns with dice capitals. The columns themselves, however, are replicas. The gothic lancet windows in the Romanesque vaults were inserted later. The chapel thus resembled the style of the Magdalen Chapel of St. Emmeram in Regensburg. With its partial position in the torturmurm, the chapel represents a special form of castles.</p>

              A structured light scanner is a 3D intruments to achieve the 3D shape of a object. It uses projection light patterns and a camera system (usually two cameras). Projection band of lights onto an object, produces line distorted from the different perspectives, and it is used to extract the 3D information about the object.
