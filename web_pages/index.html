					<!--<p>History of the site</p>-->
					<p> East of Regensburg (southern Germany), the township of Donaustauf is situated. The small city is dominated by the ruins of the castle Donaustauf. The castle sits on a hilltop, approximately 100m above the Danube. It is the oldest castle mentioned in documents within the area of Regensburg. Between 914 and 930, several records can be found that mention a castle which is called Stauff (castellum quod dicitur Stuffo). It is assumed that the castle was erected by Bishop Tuto of Regensburg (893–930), as a defence against the Hungarian invasion. However, archaeological excavations revealed that at least the North-Eastern part of the hilltop was fortified about 500 B.C. already.</p>

					<p>Since the 10th century, the castle has had an eventful history: Just between 1132 and 1161 it was seized four times. Finally, the Donaustauf castle was sieged and conquered by Swedish troops in 1634. They destroyed the castle over several days of artillery fire, and explosions. After that, repairs were done but since 1648 it has been abandoned and used as a quarry. A cemetery is located within the outer castle walls, which is still in use today.</p>
					<p>Over the centuries, sector fortifications have been built to protect the castle. In other words, the hill on which the castle stands was fortified from top to bottom and this fortification was adapted to the different needs of the time. The oldest part dates back to the 11th century, the last strengthening was carried out in 1620.</p>
					<p>To protect the central part of the castle, six gates were built (A-F). Only four of them are visible today. The most impressive gate is the most inner gate to the bailey castle (gate F). (Figure 40) The entrance is covered by two groin vaults that are separated by a wide arch. In the first floor of the building even today the castle chapel is still visible.</p>

					<!--<p>History of the site</p>-->
					<p> Based on the field experience by ArcTron3D, a code of practise for digitisation is presented.
The airborne technology will be used to create a model of the hilltop and the landscape. The landscape model will include the hilltop of the castle, the Danube, the town and part of the backcountry. The data-acquisition will be done using the ultra light paraglide trike and a Nikon D800E camera. To create a valid and useable result one will define a flight path before to ensure good coverage and overlapping of the pictures. There is already an existing 3D model. This dataset, which is available within ArcTron3D, can be used as a reference dataset by the fellows. For smaller areas of importance or to fill possible holes in the ground mesh, a UAV can be used. Depending on the resolution and the size of the area the cameras and lenses to be used as well as the flight altitude and duration should be taken into consideration among other important factors.

					<p>A ground plan using GPS sensors and/or laser scanners and the total stations could also be useful to verify and update existing plans as well as to georeference the object for further detailed studies of the chapel and the gate.</p>
					<p>Made of Romanesque fabric, Gate F is one of the most interesting parts of the castle. Therefore, a detailed and precise documentation of it should be done. Different methods of terrestrial laser scanning, terrestrial photogrammetry and even airborne photogrammetry, using the UAV, can be applied.</p>
					<p>On the preserved walls of the chapel there are traces of painting, dating back to the 12th century.  Since the walls of the chapel have recently been whitewashed it is not longer possible to see these tracings (Figure 40, Figure 41). However, there are drawings in books available to reconstruct the scenes on the wall. Given the available equipment in the consortium it will be interesting to see if one is able to discover the paintings underneath the whitewash. The paintings itself, as far as they have been documented yet, depicts for persons exchanging a book-shape like thing. Above there is a Latin inscription as well, referring to the Virgin Walpurga (known as Saint Walpurga 710-777/779). It might be interesting to try to figure out the whole story of the painting and the story that is depicted. Linking the paintings of the chapel wall with other content or even bringing the figures back to life will be a challenge for the task that concern the intangible CH part of the project.</p>	
					<p>The chapel itself is of great historical value, being one of the few Romanesque chapels within the region since it still has some of the original plaster such as capitals, columns, arches, etc. Structured light scanning (SLS) methods in comparison to photogrammetry and infrared/hyperspectral imaging can be applied to document this part.</p>
					<p>4D models of the gate would also be a possible task for the project fellows. 2D-Content such as the Merian sketch , can be brought into the project as well. Also there are some rough sketches by the American painter Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851)  and other artists . So it should not be a problem to try to rebuild the gate over time based on research that has been done, the available sketches and the researched realised by the fellows. This will bring in the 4th dimension: “time”.</p>
