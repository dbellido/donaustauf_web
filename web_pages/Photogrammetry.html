          <!--<p>History of the site</p>-->
          <p> Capturing 3D space with images is a technique that has been used for over a century. It was originally developed as a research area of surveying where certain instruments (such as the stereo comparator by Dr. Carl Pulfrich, 1901) and specially designed cameras were used to capture and measure the terrain from terrestrial or aerial platforms. Although from the mid 1970’s, computers gradually replaced the traditional instruments, the software still requires operation by well-trained users. Moreover, the cost of these special cameras was high. In close range photogrammetry applications (archaeology, architecture, industry, medicine, etc.) analogue cameras were gradually replaced by digital cameras. The development of new algorithms to automate the manual procedures, allow using any type of camera and to achieve cost reduction was a big challenge.</p>

          <p> In recent decades, computer vision emerged as the research field that copes with these problems towards the automation of the work chain and cost minimization. Compact consumer cameras and free open source software can be used to achieve results as good as the traditional techniques or even better in terms of precision, time consumption and cost.</p>

          <p> Aerial Photogrammetry as well as close range (terrestrial) photogrammetry is commonly applied to document CH objects, as such methods capture sufficiently the geometry as well as the texture of an object  (Fritschb, 2014b).</p>

          <!--<p>History of the site</p>-->
          <p> An image is a 2D projection of the 3D real world. However, by using two images that depict the same object from two different perspectives, one can extract 3D information, imitating the human vision system  (Hartley and Zisserman, 2003; Szeliski, 2010, Georgopoulos, 2014; Van Gool, 2014). Detailed 3D models of objects can be produced using images taken even with low cost handheld cameras or smart devices equipped with such sensors.</p>

          <p> In particular, 3D information will be available just for the overlapping area between the images. The relative pose, e.g. relative rotation and translation, of the image pair should be calculated. For that purpose, the coordinate difference between homologous pixels (feature correspondences) between the images is used. These feature pairs are obtained using feature extraction (e.g. SIFT (Lowe, 2004)) and image matching techniques. Given the relative pose of the cameras, their path can be estimated with respect to a common coordinate system. Finally, the 3D object coordinates are computed using triangulation and thus, the 3D point cloud is reconstructed. Structure- from-motion (SfM) algorithms use feature correspondences for camera pose estimation, while multi-view-stereo (MVS) methods take image pose as input and produce dense 3D models (Furukawa et al., 2010; Szeliski, 2010; Seitz et al., 2006; Makantasis et al., 2014).</p>

          <p> Traditionally, some prior knowledge about the camera calibration or ground truth constraints was used for 3D extraction. However, recent research in computer vision offers a more flexible solution by using robust algorithms (Figure 9). Random images of the same object, also collected from the Web via Open Access Image Repositories (like https://www.flickr.com/ ), can be used to produce dense and accurate 3D models of a scene (Agarwal et al., 2010; Hadjiprocopis et al. 2014). Scientists are even working towards real time performance, also known in the robotics community as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). Mobile robots build maps of their environment while calculating their location at the same time (Davison, 2003).</p>

          <h2  class="section-title"><span>HDR (High Dynamic Range Images)</span></h2>

          <div class="col-sm-12">

          <p>Through the process of eye adaptation, the human vision system is able to cope with the wide range of lighting in the real world. High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging is a new frontier in image capture, storage, manipulation, transmission, and display of images. The dynamic range of a digital camera can be described as the ratio of maximum light intensity measurable to the minimum light intensity measurable. The most common unit for measuring the dynamic range in a digital camera is the f-stop, which describes the total light range by powers of 2. A contrast ratio of 1024:1 could therefore also be described as having a dynamic range of 10 f-stops. (210=1024).</p>

          <p>The average luminance level of a typical starlit night is around 10-3 cd/m2 whereas daylight scenes are close to 106 cd/m2. Normal cameras usually present two orders of magnitudes between the minimum and the maximum luminance. 
          Images taken under extreme lighting environments lead to underexposed and/or overexposed pixels, causing irreplaceable information loss and thus degrade the digital representation (Gamal, 2002). Through a series of techniques HDR imaging enables the wide range of real-world lighting levels to be represented (Banterle et al., 2011).</p>
          
          <p>HDR captured images record the full range of light arriving at a point in space, therefore they contain information about the shape, colour and intensity of direct light sources as well as the colour and distribution of the indirect light from surfaces in the rest of the scene. HDR images are captured by specially designed sensors (Figure 11) or by image processing techniques. An HDR image is actually a radiance map that comes in a 32-bit format which is not displayable in common digital media (Chermak et al., 2014). Tone mapping is the technique to convert high dynamic range images to low dynamic (LDR) range ones without loss of detail.</p>

          <p>This information can be exploited for detecting light sources and using them for relighting objects. Using suitable rendering algorithms HDR images can simulate accurately how objects would look as if they were illuminated by light from the real world. This technique is called Image Base Lighting (IBL) (Debevec, 2008).</p>

          <p>The other fundamental technology for IBL is global illumination. These are algorithms able to simulate how light travels from light sources, reflects between surfaces and produces the appearance of the computer-generated objects in rendering.</p> 

          <p>Together HDR-IBL and global illumination can authentically relight virtual CH sites (Happa et al., 2009). HDR imaging is an ideal tool for overcoming adverse lighting conditions in standard documentation practices. It has been shown that HDR images do not alter the intrinsic geometric parameters of the camera, thus allowing for accurate documentation products (Ntregka et al., 2013). Recent studies work towards using HDR imaging for feature detection, tracking and 3D reconstruction (Chermak et al., 2014, Chermak and Aouf 2012, Kontogianni and Georgopoulos 2014).</p>
